**INSTALLATION**

    CD in your resources/[esx] folder

    Import esx_nightclub.sql in your database

    Add this in your server.cfg :

start bob74_ipl
start esx_nightclub
start ft_libs

**NOTES**

Its based on the esx_nightclub, I took the esx_policejob and esx_jb_dj and included it. You schouldnt restart it while in game (the game could crash). If you do, first stop ft_libs and then start the job.
You add the music and the Vehicles in the Config file. (ignore the german music in the Config).

If youre not german you also have to translate the [de.lua] dont use the en.lua

You need to add the code in /optionalneeds and /basicneeds in esx_basicneeds and esx_optionalneeds.

Have fun with it
